## About Me
I'm Andrew, a Senior at NYU Center of Data Science pursuing a joint major in Computer Science and Data Science, with minors in Business Studies and Integrated Design and Media. Originally from Taiwan and currently based in New York, I've had the privilege of studying in Prague and Paris through NYU's study abroad programs.

I'm particularly passionate about machine learning, especially in signal processing and natural language processing. My ultimate goal is to work on projects that bridge machine learning with natural sciences - projects like the Earth Species Project that sparked my interest in data science!

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- 🥊 Training for Muay Thai
- 📘 Reading (currently flipping through the MIT Essential Knowledge series!)
- 🌍 Learning new languages and exploring different cultures
- 🍻 Documenting my adventures through memorable bars around the world
