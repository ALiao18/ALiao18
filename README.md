## About Me
My name is, a Senior at NYU Center of Data Science pursuing a joint major in Computer Science and Data Science. I am from Taiwan and am currently based in New York City. 

I am currently involved with the [CN^3 lab]([url](https://cn3laboratory.org/home.html)), working on
1. AutoML models for Febrile Seizure (FS) and Sudden Unexpected Death in Children (SUDC) classification
2. Neural Decoding models for breathing and whisking in mice

I have previously worked on
1. Emergent Misalignment in Mixture of Expert (MoE) LLMs
2. Probabilistic graphical models and reinforcement learning for cognitive-map formation and exploration-efficient inference in aliased environments.

My research interests include RL, computational neuroscience, and robotics.
